# Hotel Booking Website

This project is a full-stack web application designed for booking hotels. The system integrates dynamic data such as hotel listings, flight details, and weather updates. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this project demonstrates the connection between the frontend and backend, handling user requests efficiently.

### Key Features:
- **Frontend (React)**: 
  - Developed using React for a dynamic, responsive user interface.
  - Handles user interactions, including hotel search, booking, and displaying information fetched from the backend.
  - Utilizes React Router for seamless navigation between pages (e.g., Home, Hotel Listings, Booking).

- **Backend (Node.js + Express.js)**: 
  - Node.js and Express.js power the server-side of the application.
  - RESTful API endpoints are created to handle hotel searches, flight details, and weather updates.
  - Authentication and session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure login and user sessions.

- **Database (MongoDB)**:
  - MongoDB stores hotel information, user data, and booking history.
  - Utilizes Mongoose to interact with MongoDB and manage data efficiently.

- **API Integration**:
  - Integrated with external APIs to fetch dynamic data like hotel listings, flight details, and weather updates.
  - API calls are made on the backend to retrieve relevant information and send it to the frontend.

- **Frontend and Backend Connection**:
  - The frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful API calls to fetch and display dynamic data.
  - Axios is used for handling HTTP requests between the client and server.
  - Data is fetched from the server and displayed in real-time without page reloads, creating a smooth user experience.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, JWT Authentication
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
- **API Integration**: Third-party APIs for hotel, flight, and weather data
- **Others**: Git, npm
