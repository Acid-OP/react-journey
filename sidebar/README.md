# Toggleable Sidebar with Routing

This project implements a toggleable sidebar in React with complete routing functionality. The sidebar dynamically updates the main content area based on the selected route, ensuring seamless navigation within the application. Additionally, an alternate approach to creating sidebars, named **basic-project-1**, is included but is currently in an unfinished state.

## Features
- **Toggleable Sidebar**: The sidebar can be shown or hidden based on user interaction.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Routes are defined in the sidebar, and clicking on them updates the main content area accordingly.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes for a user-friendly experience.
- **Alternate Approach**: Includes an unfinished implementation (`basic-project-1`) for exploration and future improvements.

## Installation
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```

## Usage

### Example Code
Here’s an example of how the toggleable sidebar and routing are structured:

#### Sidebar Component
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Sidebar({ isOpen, toggleSidebar }) {
  return (
    <div className={`sidebar ${isOpen ? 'open' : 'closed'}`}>
      <button onClick={toggleSidebar}>Toggle Sidebar</button>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><Link to="/route1">Route 1</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/route2">Route 2</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/route3">Route 3</Link></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Sidebar;
```

#### App Component with Routing
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Sidebar from './Sidebar';

function App() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(true);

  const toggleSidebar = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);

  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="app">
        <Sidebar isOpen={isOpen} toggleSidebar={toggleSidebar} />
        <div className="main-content">
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/route1" element={<div>Content for Route 1</div>} />
            <Route path="/route2" element={<div>Content for Route 2</div>} />
            <Route path="/route3" element={<div>Content for Route 3</div>} />
          </Routes>
        </div>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Alternate Approach: basic-project-1
An alternate implementation for sidebars, named **basic-project-1**, is included. While it’s currently in an unfinished state, it demonstrates another way to structure the sidebar and routing logic. Contributions to improve this implementation are welcome.

## Development
To run the project locally:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Roadmap
- Refine the UI for `basic-project-1`.
- Add animations for sidebar transitions.
- Implement user authentication to control access to routes.
- Enhance responsiveness for mobile devices.
